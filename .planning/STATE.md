# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-09)

**Core value:** A learner can study their own PDFs and achieve delayed, AI-independent recall and application of the material, built on faithfully reconstructed, source-grounded content that never invents facts.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Secure, Durable Foundation & Packaging Gate

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 12 (Secure, Durable Foundation & Packaging Gate)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-09 (roadmap created: 12 phases, 136/136 v1 requirements mapped)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: The research's Foundation and Durable kernel phases were merged into Phase 1 to fit 12 phases. The kernel still precedes PDF import.
- [Roadmap]: The complete model manager and runtime (Phase 4) precede document intelligence (Phase 5). The asset store comes before OCR, and the probe, registry and evals come before LLM use.
- [Roadmap]: Learning (Phase 9) runs before Audio (Phase 10) to close the core-value loop sooner. S-TTS still runs early in the spike track.
- [Roadmap]: Engine spikes (S-PACKAGE, S-PDF, S-RUNTIME, S-EMBED, S-OCR, S-LAYOUT, E-LANG, S-TTS) run as a parallel track through /gsd-spike. Each consuming phase is gated on its ADR.
- [Roadmap]: Open product decisions (D-*) gate specific phases. Execution stops and raises them, never decides them silently.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: D-LICENSE (Danesh's own license) needs a product decision before REL-08 and any engine ADR.
- [Phase 1]: S-PACKAGE has to prove native bindings plus a tiny GGUF, OCR and TTS in utilityProcess on clean, packaged Windows and macOS builds. Failure would force an architecture change.
- [Phase 4]: D-COMMERCIAL and D-DISTRIB (model licenses, hosting mirrors, offline bundles) need decisions before the registry and downloads ship.
- [Phase 10]: Persian TTS naturalness and voice licensing are unproven. S-TTS needs at least 3 native listeners and should start early.
- [All engine phases]: There is no public Persian quality evidence for any candidate engine or model, so every choice is spike-gated with pass policies written first.
